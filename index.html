        <section id="about" class="page-sections">
          <p>
            Hi! I’m Karina, an enthusiastic
            <b>UX/UI and Frontend Developer</b>. I hold two Bachelor's degrees:
            Information and Communication Technology Engineering and Business
            Management. My latest academic journey has been focused on
            <b>Web Design, Software Development, and Web Applications</b>,
            awakening my aspiration to bring clear and usable UI designs into
            life.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
            During my studies, I have gained comprehensive knowledge about Web
            Development, UI and UX design and development with
            <b>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</b>, as well as more modern frameworks
            and libraries such as <b>React, Bootstrap and Tailwind</b>. I have
            created and used multiple <b>SQL, Firebase and MariaDB</b> databases
            and contributed to an <b>Amazon Dynamo</b> database. I am skilled in
            version control through <b>GitHub</b> and have been using
            <b>Node</b> regularly. Other skills I have picked up along the way
            are mentioned in more detail in the
            <a href="#contact">skills</a> section, such as
            <b>Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator</b>.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
            I have gained professional experience from being a part of a
            fast-scaling startup company in 2020, where I held a 6 month
            internship position as a <b>Fullstack Developer</b>. Here I became
            familiar with <b>Vue.js and Firebase</b>. This internship inspired
            me to expand my knowledge on usability and
            <b>End-to-End testing with Cypress</b>, which is what I wrote my
            last thesis on. In my current postition as a Coordinator for a
            Business Technology Consulting company Sofigate, I have been able to
            connect my two degrees, Business and ICT, and see how the two areas
            can be improved to work better and more seamlessly to accelerate
            value. During my spare time, I have taken <b>ServiceNow</b> Portal
            Development courses, to boarden my knowledge on digital workflow
            management and Portal development. I have been introduced to
            <b>DevOps</b> ways of working through coordinating training events
            as well as simulations. I had the chance to develop an AI assistant
            bot with <b>CustomGPT</b> for the IT and Security department, which
            gained positive feedback from employees and the CIO.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
            <b>To wrap up</b>, my absolute most <b>favourite</b> thing to do is
            <b
              >enhancing user experiences through clear and pleasing Frontend
              development</b
            >. I love crafting visually appealing interfaces but also in
            ensuring seamless user interactions, responsiveness and scalability.
